  <p>Thank you for registering as a Code Club Aotearoa venue! Code Club now have over 100 clubs available for kiwi kids to join!</p>
  <p>If you haven't yet found a volunteer to help run your club, we suggest heading to our <a href="http://www.codeclub.nz/start-a-club/volunteers/list/?r=">volunteers page</a> and making contact with someone in your area. If you're a school, adding a notice to a school newsletter can help find those parents with a background in programming who are excited to learn a local venue is wanting to teach kids to code! Tweeting is another great way to get the word out, be sure to tag <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeClubNZ">@CodeClubNZ</a> so we can retweet and spread the word. Also look out for the next Meetup happening in your area, you can join the group on our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-Club-Aotearoa/">Meetup page</a>.</p>
  <p>All volunteers who are not registered New Zealand teachers will need to be police vetted.
    Volunteers will be sent all the details of this when they sign up. If you are an Approved Agency, such as a school, you may prefer to submit your own vetting request. We will need to see a copy of all returned police vets in this situation.</p>
    There are some rules around who needs to be present during a club meeting, these can be viewed on <a href="http://www.codeclub.nz/resources/">our website</a>, and we require all venues to follow these rules.
  <p>As your club grows you may find you have many questions, these have usually been answered by those with experience. We invite you to join our private <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CodeClubNZNetwork/">Facebook group</a> for venues and volunteers. No question is too big or small.</p>
  <p>All of our projects are available on the Code Club World <a href="http://projects.codeclubworld.org/en-GB/">project page</a>.Any further questions please don't hesitate to contact us at support@codeclub.nz</p>
