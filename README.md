# code-club-utils
This repo exists to share a bunch of useful scripts with countries who want to set up code club websites.

As this is the first attempt at sharing code between code club organisations, there may be some wrinkles in the process to iron out. Please raise issues or fork the repo if you have any improvements or ideas to offer!
