## What else?

I acknowledge that there are terrible bits within the code enclosed - there is much to be improved. Such is the nature of volunteer projects.

What we are doing here is enabling education and computer literacy for a new generation of kids, especially those that are underprivileged.

If you do have improvements to suggest, or spot bugs or flaws in the code, please do the right thing and disclose to me at support@codeclub.nz or raise an issue against the repo.
