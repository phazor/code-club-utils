		<h3>Your role as a volunteer</h3>

		<p>Volunteering for Code Club involves travelling to your local primary or intermediate school or public venue once a week to run your club for one hour. Lots of volunteers team up with colleagues or friends to run a club - they then help each other to run the club during the term.</p>

		<p>Wherever possible volunteers team up with a teacher - think of them as your club partner. Clubs are most successful when teachers and volunteers work together combining their classroom management and programming powers!</p>

		<p>As a Code Club leader you'll be able to take our projects to the school for the children to work through. Our projects use Scratch in the first two terms in order to teach the basic concepts of programming, then move onto HTML & CSS and Python.</p>

		<p>Code Club is designed to be fun and creative. You will be a role model for potential coding kids everywhere, show them how enthusiastic you are and how much you love programming!</p>

		<p>You can run your Code Club pretty much anywhere you like as long as it's safe, has computers, and has a supervisor from the venue who can be there each week. Primary and intermediate schools are best as this infrastructure already exists but libraries, community centres, and museums will all work well too.</p>

		<p>Convincing your boss is easier than you think. Lots of employers encourage their developers to give back to the local community and allow them time out to run a club. It raises their profile in the area and means children are being taught important digital skills that could benefit the industry in the future.</p>

		<h3>Know what you're signing up for</h3>

		<p><strong>Please note you do need to have a reasonable knowledge of computer programming to be a Code Club volunteer.</strong></p>

		<p>Our first term uses Scratch but we soon move on to more advanced languages such as Python.</p>

		<p>Volunteering for Code Club will be the best thing you do this year. Guaranteed. But there are some things you should know before you sign up.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Each Code Club lasts for 1 hour and happens once a week.</li>
			<li>In New Zealand any adult who wishes to work with children using Code Club Aotearoa material must have a <a href="http://www.justice.govt.nz/services/criminal-records/how-to-get-a-copy-of-your-criminal-conviction-history" target="_blank">background criminal record check</a> conducted and sent to us.</li>
			<li>You will need to print and staple a copy of project instructions for each child or pair of children. You will need preparation time to do this. Unfortunately we can’t cover these expenses.</li>
			<li>Please allow for travel time too.</li>
			<li>You will not be allowed to charge for your club under any circumstance. Code Club is free for all!</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What we teach</h3>

		<p>You can access the full set of projects <a href="/projects">here</a>. We recommend always starting with Scratch but if you'd like to move onto Python rather than HTML, that is fine with us!</p>

		<strong>Term One: Scratch</strong>

		<p>This term will take your club from a tour of the Scratch interface right through three levels of difficulty. The projects create games, animations and toys. There are basic exercises then challenges to stretch those that can go further.</p>

		<strong>Term Two: Scratch - Advanced</strong>

		<p>This term will really stretch your club’s abilities requiring them to use what they learned in term one. The projects in this term have been designed to be very flexible. They encourage and require high levels of thought and creativity.</p>

		<strong>Term Three: HTML & CSS</strong>

		<p>In this term your club will learn how the building blocks of the web work and will build their own website.</p>

		<strong>Term Four: Python</strong>

		<p>In this term we introduce your club to real life programming. We teach basic concepts via the fun of turtles, fractals and ciphers!</p>

		<h3>How to set up a Code Club</h3>

		<p><strong>We've tried to make volunteering for Code Club as easy and quick as possible. When you register we'll walk you through a checklist, but we've outlined the process here as well.</strong></p>

		<ol>
			<li>Use the search button below to find a venue to host your club in.</li>
			<li>Contact the venue: if they are already registered with us as looking for a volunteer then they should be receptive. If they're a school who isn't registered we'd recommend trying to get in touch with the ICT Coordinator. Or if you're contacting a public venue then find out who is responsible for running clubs. Make sure they understand that a member of staff will need to help you out.</li>
			<li>Arrange when your club will start and what days and times it will run after that. You'll also need to agree the number of children in your club. We suggest 10-15 per club.</li>
			<li>Introduce Code Club at assembly or via posters to explain how much fun computer programming can be and drum up some interest.</li>
			<li>Download the materials from our resources page and prepare for your first club!</li>
