		<h3>Getting started</h3>

		<p>Code Club will teach your child much more than how to make computer games, animations, and websites. Our projects are designed to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>strengthen problem solving & logical thinking skills</li>
			<li>nurture imagination and creative thinking</li>
			<li>encourage learning through exploration</li>
			<li>teach children how to break large problems into small manageable chunks</li>
			<li>encourage collaboration with others</li>
			<li>and most of all, be FUN!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Each term, children will progress through new projects. Terms 1 & 2 will use Scratch (which can be downloaded from the web) to teach the basics of programming. Term 3 will teach the basics of web development using HTML and CSS. Term 4 will teach Python. We encourage children to carry on with their projects at home if they have enjoyed them.</p>

		<p><em>Does this sound like something your child might be interested in? Does their little face light up? Would their friends be interested too?</em></p>

		<p>Here are three things you can do to get started:</p>

		<ol>		
			<li>Search for existing clubs in your  <a  href="/start-a-club/venues/list/?r=">local area</a>.</li>
			<li>Approach your child’s school about <a href="/start-a-club/venues">hosting a club</a>.</li>
			<li>Assist in finding a <a href="/start-a-club/volunteers">volunteer</a>.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Helping set up a Code Club at your school</h3>

		<p>The first thing you can do is inform your child’s school about the existence of Code Club. Try chatting to some other parents and see if they sound interested, then get a meeting with your school’s principal so you can explain why it is so important to your child, and how it will help the school.</p>

		<p>Code Club volunteers are currently in huge demand, so it may be quicker to help find a volunteer from within your community. Our volunteer page has all the information you need. Please contact us at any time if you would like any assistance or further resources.</p>

		<p>Local community facilities such as libraries are also excellent venues to host clubs.</p>

		<h3>Use our materials at home</h3>

		<p>Alternatively, if you have no luck getting a Code Club off the ground in your area - or if you home school your children - you could download our materials for use at home.</p>
